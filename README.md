Starpage is startpage with Catppuccin Mocha colors. Now there's not many functions, but i plan to add:
- [x] Customisable links list (using cookies)
- [ ] Customisable logo (again, using cookies)
- [ ] Search bar

## How to change links?
- 1. Install "Cookie Editor" for your browser
- 2. Open editor and redact cookie named "links"
- 3. Name: name of site, you'll see it on this page
- 4. URL: URL to page. Don't forget to add "https://" in the start of URL!
